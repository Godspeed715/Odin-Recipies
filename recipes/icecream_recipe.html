        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When you think about cool, contemporary desserts taking the food world by storm, there are two words that likely don't come to mind: soft serve. As in, soft serve ice cream. But while we were busy marveling at gooey-centered molten chocolate cake – and while molecular gastronomists were whipping ice cream over liquid nitrogen – soft serve ice cream was making a serious comeback, in New York, LA, Portland, and beyond. Here's more on the trend – and two easy ways to make your own soft serve at home.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound strawberries</li>
            <li>1 cupcoconut cream</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp xanthan gum (a natural stablizer that's easy to find at specialty supermarkets)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup light corn syrup</li>
            <li>1/3 cup water</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>

                <h3>Making the <Base></Base></h3>
                Remove the green tops from the strawberries and slice them into perfect slices. Toss the berries in sugar until they are completely coated and cook in a 350-degree oven until they are perfectly cooked, slightly caramelized, and overwhelmingly aromatic, about 10 minutes. Remove the strawberries from the oven and allow to cool to room temp. Once the berries are cooled, puree them really well with a blender. Pass the berries through a fine mesh strainer to get out most of the remaining pulp and seeds.
                Stir together about one fourth of the sugar with all of the xanthan gum in a small bowl. Pour the water in a small saucepan, add the sugar mixture and immediately whisk vigorously until very smooth (don't fret over a few lumps). Stir in the corn syrup. Set the pan over medium heat and cook, stirring often and adjusting the heat if necessary to prevent a simmer, until the sugar has fully dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and immediately whisk in the strained berry puree and the coconut cream.
                Transfer the soft serve base into an airtight container and refrigerate until well chilled, about four hours, or, for even better texture and flavor, 24 hours.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Churning the Soft Serve</h3>Pour the soft serve base into a standard at-home ice cream maker and turn on the machine. Churn just until the mixture has the desired texture of soft serve, about 15 to 25 minutes depending on the machine. Use a spatula to scoop all of the ice cream into a piping bag and pipe the ice cream out into a cone! This soft serve could be stored, covered, in the freezer for up to two weeks but should be very tediously tempered before eating after being frozen.</li>
