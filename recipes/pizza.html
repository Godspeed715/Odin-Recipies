        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 Â½ cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions </h2>

            <li>Step 5: Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle</li>
